 # DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER PARAMETER ESTIMATION SYSTEM
# Description
* This estimator system helps the user to get complete information about the Distribution Transformer for various input load conditions per annum.
* This system estimates Output energy of a transformer,Energy spent on copper loss;iron loss,Efficiency of the transformer,Operational cost of Distribution,Optimal load and Maximum possible Efficiency of a given Distribution Transformer.
* It helps in reducing manual Calculation and makes our job easier once we have lot of dynamically varying load conditions.
# Functions
* Structures
* Pointer
* User Defined Header File
* Unity Test Framework
* Compatibility with Windows and Linux
# Approach
* Multi file programming
* Makefile to compile,run,test and check code coverage
* Makefile which works both in linux and windows
# IDE used
* Visual studio code
# Requirements
* Unit Framework Library
* MakeFile Configuration
* Mingw-w64(It runs on 64Bit but there is option for 32 bit too)
* gcc compiler
* Additional Visual studio code extension
  * Extension C/C++ 
  * Doxygen Extension
  * C/C++ Debugger Configuration
* Code Coverage
* CppCheck(Static memory analysis)
* Git-2.31.0-64-bit
# Run the project
* Clone the entire repo
* Store it in your local machine 
* Open cmd(windows) or terminal(linux) at the Project implementation loacation
* Commands
  * To compile: use **make** command
  * To run: use **make run** command
  * To do unit testing: use **make test** command
  * To do code coverage: use **make coverage** command
* While the code is running,follow the instructions in cmd or terminal.
* You are done!!

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
Introduction
The Project deals with the Estimation of Distribution Transformer Parameters for a given Load conditions per annum. It calculates all informations related to Distribution of Electrical Energy via a Distribution Transformer such as Efficiency of Transmission, Energy Received, Energy loss in the form of Copper loss and Iron loss and most importantly the operational cost of the transformer. This project aimed at the job simplification and reducing the manual work and hereby saving the time of manual calculations on various load conditions. Optimal load is calculated for the given Transformer which is nothing but the load at which the Efficiency of Transmission is maximum. Using optimal load, maximum efficiency is also calculated. User can understand the difference in efficiency for the practical load conditions and the maximum possible efficiency.
System Analysis (Research)
This system is basically concerned with the Distribution transformer parameter estimation like efficiency of Transmission of electrical energy in comparison with the maximum efficiency. The primary need of the system arises because as is the known fact that the loads connected to the distribution system varies according to time and hence calculating the required information for a dynamically varying load manually is quite a tough job. By computerizing it, we will be able to handle the dynamic data more efficiently. Handling of such variations and calculating parameters for such system is a very complex task if it is done manually but it can be made much easier if the system is computerized.

Defining the system
o Functions used:
❖ Output Energy
-After entering the transformer data, user can get output energy as a result after computation.
❖ Copper loss energy
-With the load data and rating of the transformer, copper loss in KWh is calculated.
❖ Iron loss energy
-With the iron loss in KW, energy spent for iron loss is calculated as Iron loss is independent of load value and rating of the transformer.
❖ Optimal load
-With the value of losses and rating , optimal load is calculated.
❖ Operational Cost
-With the energy values in KWh and cost of electrical energy per unit , cost of operation is estimated.
❖ Efficiency
-Efficiency for a given load condition is compared with maximum efficiency possible for the transformer.
❖ Display
-Estimated parameters of a transformer is displayed
